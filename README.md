# 🌱 SmartAgroAI

## 📌 Project Overview

**SmartAgroAI** is an intelligent web-based application built to support farmers, researchers, and policymakers in making **data-driven agricultural decisions**.  
The platform integrates **AI-powered crop recommendation models** with **NASA’s open datasets** (climate, soil, and satellite imagery) to provide insights on:

* ✅ Best crops to grow in a given location  
* ✅ Soil and weather conditions  
* ✅ Rainfall and temperature forecasts  
* ✅ Sustainable farming practices  

🌱 **AI Crop Recommendation Engine**  
SmartAgroAI leverages machine learning models trained on climate, soil, and historical yield data to recommend the most suitable crops for a farmer’s region. The system continuously adapts as new environmental and agricultural data becomes available, ensuring **accurate and location-specific recommendations**.  

🎮 **Educational Farming Game**  
To make the platform more engaging, SmartAgroAI also features a **gamified learning experience** where users (especially students and young farmers) can simulate farming decisions. In the game, players select crops, manage resources, and respond to changing weather conditions. The outcomes are guided by real-world AI insights, helping users learn sustainable agricultural practices in an **interactive and fun way**.  

This project was developed as part of the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**.
